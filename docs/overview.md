# Rocket Overview

## Quick Hitting Items / Work

I am constantly getting slowed down, because I "get the feeling" that a given idea or
repo is at the point where it won't be able to be pushed forward anymore - that the next
step is essentiall too difficult to even try.

But, as it turns out, there is usually someone out there that has crossed these hurdles -
and, since Claude has read the entire Internet, he knows, too.

So, the "Rocket" project is to blow through those barriers. Just make Claude do the
impossible. If he can't, then he can't. But he has always been able to do it, in my
experience.
